# Ethanol-blends-in-SI-engines
This study is based on the performance parameters and emission characteristics of ethanol when mixed with gasoline to be used as a fuel in Spark Ignition Engine.

Performance parameters include Brake Power (BP), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), Indicated Power, Indicated Thermal Efficiency, Mechanical Efficiency, Brake specific energy consumption (bsec) with using ethanol gasoline (20% and 30%) blends and comparison with pure gasoline.

Emission characteristics include carbon dioxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and NOx emission with ethanol gasoline blends and comparison with pure gasoline.
